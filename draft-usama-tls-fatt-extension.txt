                     Extensions to TLS FATT Process
                 draft-usama-tls-fatt-extension-latest

Abstract

   This document applies only to non-trivial extensions of TLS, which
   require formal analysis.  It proposes the authors provide a threat
   model and informal security goals in the Security Considerations
   section, and a protocol diagram in the draft.  We also briefly
   present a few pain points of the one doing the formal analysis which
   require refining the process:

   *  Contacting FATT

   *  Understanding the opposing goals

   *  No response from some authors

   *  Slots at meeting

1.  Introduction

   While the TLS FATT process [TLS-FATT] marks a historic change in
   achieving high cryptographic assurances by tightly integrating formal
   methods in the working group (WG) process, the current FATT process
   has some practical limitations.  Given a relatively smaller formal
   methods community, and a steep learning curve as well as very low
   consideration of usability in the existing formal analysis tools,
   this document proposes some solutions to make the FATT process
   sustainable.

   Specifically, the TLS FATT process does not outline the division of
   responsibility between the authors and the one doing the formal
   analysis (the latter is hereafter referred to as the "verifier").
   This document aims to propose some solutions without putting an
   extensive burden on either party.

   An argument is often presented by the authors that an Internet-Draft
   is written for the implementers.  We make several counter-arguments
   here:

   *  Researchers and protocol designers are also stakeholders of such
      specifications [I-D.irtf-cfrg-cryptography-specification].

   *  Even implementers may like to understand the security implications
      before blindly starting to implement it.

   *  With the FATT process, this argument is clearly invalid.  The
      verifier may not be the same as the implementer.

   This document outlines the corresponding changes in the way Internet-
   Drafts are typically written.  For the Internet-Draft to be useful
   for the formal analysis, this document proposes that the draft should
   contain three main items, namely:

   *  a threat model,

   *  informal security goals, and

   *  a protocol diagram (Section 3.1).

   Each one of these is summarized in Section 4.  Future versions of
   this draft will include concrete examples.

   Responsibilities of the verifier are summarized in Section 5.

1.1.  Motivation

   A clear separation of resposibilities would help IRTF UFMRG to train
   the authors and verifiers separately to fulfill their own
   responsibilities.

2.  Pain Points of Verifier

   From the two extremes -- [I-D.ietf-tls-8773bis] where Russ kindly
   provided all requested inputs and we were able to get it through
   without any formal analysis to [I-D.fossati-tls-attestation-08] where
   formal analysis revealed vulnerabilities [ID-Crisis] and resulted in
   a separate WG to tackle this problem -- we summarize the pain points
   of the verifier.

2.1.  Contacting FATT

   The verifier should be allowed to contact the FATT at least once some
   draft is out from the TLS WG.  Formal methods community is small and
   those with deep knowledge of TLS are quite limited.  Not being able
   to contact them puts the verifier at great disadvantage.

2.2.  Understanding the Opposing Goals

   The authors need to understand that the task of the verifier is to
   find the subtle corner cases where the protocol may fail.  This is
   naturally opposed to the goal of the authors.  But unless the
   verifier remains really focused on doing that, there is little value
   of formal analysis.  In particular, some topics like remote
   attestation need more precise specifications because small changes
   may make a big difference.

2.3.  No Response from Some Authors

   Some authors of adopted drafts do not respond for several months,
   despite repeated reminders [FormalAnalysisPAKE].

2.4.  Slots at Meeting

   Formal analysis -- just like any other code development -- is an
   iterative process and needs to be progressively discussed with the WG
   to be able to propose secure solutions.  So at least some time should
   be allocated in the meetings for discussion of formal analysis.

   *  We requested a slot for 10 minutes (and 5 minutes if tight on
      schedule) for discussion of our questions about
      [I-D.ietf-tls-extended-key-update] at IETF 124.  It seemed that
      the slots were spread over the meeting time to show that there is
      no time left for our topic.  In the end, the meeting ended one
      hour earlier where 10 minutes from that could have been utilized
      for discussion on formal analysis of
      [I-D.ietf-tls-extended-key-update].  Given that the authors were
      informed [FormalAnalysisKeyUpdate] about the issues, what the
      authors presented was not very helpful in terms of progressing the
      formal analysis work and proposing some solutions.  Key schedule
      is a subtle topic and not something we can talk effectively on the
      mic without a proper diagram on display.  It is unclear why formal
      analysis is such a low priority to the chairs.

   *  If the authors are doing the formal analysis themselves, they
      should also present the current state of formal analysis for
      discussion.  This will help the verifier give any feedback and
      avoid any repititive effort for the verifier.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.1.  Protocol Diagram

   In the context of this document, a protocol diagram specifies the
   proposed cryptographically-relevant changes compared to the standard
   TLS protocol [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].  This is conceptually similar
   to the Protocol Model in [RFC4101].  However, while [RFC4101] only
   recommends diagrams, we consider diagrams to be essential.

3.2.  Definition of Attack

   Any ambiguity originating from the threat model, informal security
   goals, and a protocol diagram is to be considered as an attack.  The
   authors are, therefore, encouraged to be as precise as possible.

4.  Responsibilities of Authors

   This document proposes that the authors provide the following three
   items:

4.1.  Threat Model

   A threat model outlines the assumptions and known weaknesses of the
   proposed protocol.  The threat model could be the classical Dolev-Yao
   adversary.  In addition, it could specify any keys (e.g., long-term
   keys or session keys) which may be compromised (i.e., available to
   the adversary).

4.2.  Informal Security Goals

   Knowing what you want is the first step toward achieving it.  Hence,
   informal security goals such as integrity, authentication, freshness,
   etc. should be outlined in the Internet-Draft.  If the informal
   security goals are not spelled out in the Internet-Draft, it is safe
   to assume that the goals are still unclear to the authors.

4.3.  Protocol Diagram

   A protocol diagram should clearly mention the initial knowledge of
   the protocol participants, e.g., which authentic public keys are
   known to the protocol participants at the start of the protocol.  An
   example of a protocol diagram for [I-D.fossati-tls-attestation-08] is
   provided in Figure 5 in [ID-Crisis].

5.  Responsibilities of Verifier

   When the authors declare the version as ready for formal analysis,
   the verifier takes the above inputs, performs the formal analysis,
   and brings the results back to the authors and the WG.  Based on the
   analysis, the verifier may propose updates to the Security
   Considerations section or other sections of the Internet-Draft.

6.  Security Considerations

   The whole document is about improving security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
