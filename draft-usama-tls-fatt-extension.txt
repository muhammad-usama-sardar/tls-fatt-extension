1.  Introduction

   While the TLS FATT process [TLS-FATT] marks a historic change in
   achieving high cryptographic assurances by tightly integrating formal
   methods in the working group process, the current FATT process has
   some practical limitations.  Given a relatively smaller formal
   methods community, and a steep learning curve as well as very low
   consideration of usability in the existing formal analysis tools,
   this document proposes some solutions to make the FATT process
   sustainable.

   Specifically, the TLS FATT process does not outline the division of
   responsibility between the authors and the one doing the formal
   analysis (the latter is hereafter referred to as the "verifier").
   This document aims to fill this gap without putting an extensive
   burden on either party.

   An argument is often presented by the authors that an Internet-Draft
   is written for the implementers.  With the FATT process, this
   argument is no longer valid.  This document outlines the
   corresponding changes in the way Internet-Drafts are typically
   written.  For the Internet-Draft to be useful for the formal
   analysis, this document proposes a new "Formal Analysis
   Considerations" section containing three main items, namely:

   *  a threat model,

   *  informal security goals, and

   *  a protocol diagram (Section 2.1).

   Each one of these is summarized in Section 3.  Future versions of
   this draft will include concrete examples.

   Responsibilities of the verifier are summarized in Section 4.

1.1.  Motivation

   A clear separation of resposibilities would help IRTF UFMRG to train
   the authors and verifiers separately to fulfill their own
   responsibilities.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Protocol Diagram

   In the context of this document, a protocol diagram specifies the
   proposed cryptographically-relevant changes compared to the standard
   TLS protocol [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].  This is conceptually similar
   to the Protocol Model in [RFC4101].  However, while [RFC4101] only
   recommends diagrams, we consider diagrams to be essential.

2.2.  Definition of Attack

   Any ambiguity originating from the threat model, informal security
   goals, and a protocol diagram is to be considered as an attack.  The
   authors are, therefore, encouraged to be as precise as possible.

3.  Responsibilities of Authors

   This document proposes a new "Formal Analysis Considerations" section
   where the authors provide the following three items:

3.1.  Threat Model

   A threat model outlines the assumptions and known weaknesses of the
   proposed protocol.  The threat model could be the classical Dolev-Yao
   adversary.  In addition, it could specify any keys (e.g., long-term
   keys or session keys) which are assumed to be compromised (i.e.,
   available to the adversary).

3.2.  Informal Security Goals

   Knowing what you want is the first step toward achieving it.  Hence,
   informal security goals such as integrity, authentication, freshness,
   etc. should be outlined in the Internet-Draft.  If the informal
   security goals are not spelled out in the Internet-Draft, it is safe
   to assume that the goals are still unclear to the authors.  In such a
   case, the Internet-Draft should not be considered as ready for
   adoption.

3.3.  Protocol Diagram

   A protocol diagram should clearly mention the initial knowledge of
   the protocol participants, e.g., which authentic public keys are
   known to the protocol participants at the start of the protocol.  An
   example of a protocol diagram for [I-D.fossati-tls-attestation-08] is
   provided in Section 3 of [Meeting-122-TLS-Slides].

4.  Responsibilities of Verifier

   When the authors declare the version as ready for formal analysis,
   the verifier takes the above inputs, performs the formal analysis,
   and brings the results back to the authors and the working group.
   Based on the analysis, the verifier may propose updates to the
   "Formal Analysis Considerations" section, Security Considerations
   section or other sections of the Internet-Draft.

5.  Security Considerations

   The whole document is about improving security considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
